# Double-click-friendly launcher (Linux/macOS): finds Python 3 and hands off to
# bootstrap.py, which creates the venv, installs dependencies, and starts
# macrorec (with a progress splash so a double-click launch isn't silent while
# that happens) - no manual `python -m venv` / `pip install` /
# `source .venv/bin/activate` steps needed. See README.md.
#
# Assumes Python 3 itself is already installed (get it from python.org, or your
# distro's package manager, if not) - everything downstream of that is handled
# automatically by bootstrap.py.
#
# macOS note: double-clicking a .sh file in Finder usually opens it in a text
# editor rather than running it (Finder doesn't execute plain shell scripts by
# default). Run it from Terminal instead (`./LAUNCH_macrorec_LinuxMac.sh`), or
# rename this file's extension to .command, which Finder does execute on
# double-click.
